She worked tirelessly on my LinkedIn branding and website to create a more cohesive, better-organized, and stronger presentation of Gingold Advisors. Cherry took the time to carefully examine our existing materials, thoughtfully discussed our needs and goals, and delivered a final product that met our expectations and made us truly proud. Her attention to detail, creativity, and commitment to getting it right are second to none. I highly recommend Cherry to anyone serious about elevating their brand."</p>

                    <p>"I had the pleasure of working with Cherry on a comprehensive rebranding project for my LinkedIn profile, for my agency newsletter, and for my regular posts. Cherry is an outstanding design talent. She truly transformed my visual presence, making it more modern and engaging. She is also very quick, her turnaround time was remarkable, consistently delivering high-quality work well within the deadlines. Last but not least, Cherry helped me with various small tasks, always with a positive attitude and attention to detail. I highly recommend Cherry for any design or assistant needs!"</p>

                    <p>"I highly recommend Cherry for branding your profile/banner on LinkedIn. She did an incredible job understanding my creative style even better than I do, while incorporating elements that speak to my brand perfectly. Cherry transformed my LinkedIn banner into a showstopper (in my opinion). I love when you work with a creative artist that 'gets you,' and she did not disappoint! That is what Cherry did for me, and I wouldn't hesitate to work with her again in the future!"</p>

                    <p>"Cherry did a brilliant job of updating my LinkedIn profile. Based in Karachi, Pakistan, she carefully interviewed me to understand my needs and turned that into new banners and text within 24 hours. Being a bit of a tech dunce, she then patiently stayed with me in a call to show me how to upload each new piece of data to my profile until it was complete. Nothing was too much trouble. Great service and very affordable rates - thank you so much Cherry!"</p>

She did as many iterations as necessary to get a result that suited me. My impressions, search appearances and profile views went way up after working with her. 10/10 recommend!"</p>
